spanish-parsing
===============

I found a spanish dictionary in a parsing-friendly format here: https://github.com/evilgeniuschronicles/Kindle-Language-Dictionaries

This might be a good way to fill our database. Right now I'm just copying all the files to a preliminary db. But later on we might check against a list of common spanish words. I downloaded such a list.
